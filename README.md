# Virtual Pet.
___
## Description.
This was my first JavaScript project, which I created a GUI for using HTML and CSS. It was tested using Jest, the tests can be found in the \_\_tests__ folder. 

A virtual pet is created and needs to be kept alive with interactions from the user, namely by being fed and exercised. The main features are:
* The user can choose their pet avatar and name.
* There are three user interactions: the pet can have a birthday, is fed or is exercised.

When I started creating the GUI I wanted it to be something that a young child (3-5 yrs old) could use by themselves. Therefore I ensured, that as well as any written messages, there were visuals which could be easily interpreted.

In the future I would ideally like to remove the user being able to change the pet's age by having the pet automatically age with time, for example it could have a birthday every 24hrs. For now this is something the user controls.

## How to use:
On the left side there are 3 buttons:
* age your pet 
* feed them
* exercise them

On the right side there are 3 circles which tell you your pet's status:
* age
* hunger
* fitness

Firstly choose your favourite pet avatar, and then type in the name of your pet.
To get started you will need to give your pet it's first birthday.
Every time your pet has a birthday they will become hungry and start to become unfit. 
* If an empty bowl pops up they are hungry and must be fed. 
* If a koala struggling to lift weights pops up they must be exercised. 

Once these pop ups have disappeared your pet can have another birthday if not you take the risk of your pet dying. Your pet cannot be older than 30 as it will naturally die at this age.
